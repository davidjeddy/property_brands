## Unit Sort Test

### Summary

We often deal with unit number / resident name data. These two pieces of information are used by our users to identify a lease.

Many of our screens and reports show a list of leases. The task is to sort lease data read from a file and to print the sorted data to STDOUT.

The data looks as follows (actual data file attached):

```
    #50 - Smith

    #8 - Johnson

    #100 - Sanders

    #1B - Adams

    #1A â€“ Kessenich
```

Each line contains a unit number and a resident name. The data should be sorted by unit number.


# Assumptions
- Sanitized and Normalized output strings. IE each row using the same seperators between unit and name.

- Source data set could be 1 item, could a billion.

- A pre-described set of characters will separate the unit from the person in each line of the source data.

- Database storage is not available, 'cause that is how the data should be ingested, stored, egress.

- Normalized and sanitized reports are not available; thus the logic is responsible for such actions.


# Requirements

- Read data from text (txt) file.

- Sort based on #{unit number}.

- Print sorted array to stdout.

- Maintain relationship between unit number and name string.
